fs ===> CRUD
-----------------------------------

C -> Create
R -> Read
U -> Update
D -> Delete
Rename File -> Rename

---------------------------------------
Create

define source path
define destination path

Tips:
1) for later file access use async just drop it
2) for immediate file access use sync or rely on callback of file


fs.writeFile(resolvedFilePath, data, unicode, callback); // replace entirely with new content
fs.appendFile(resolvedFilePath,writeData + os.EOL,unicode,callback); // just add below the line 
fs.open(resolvedFilePath, flag, mod, callback);
fs.rename(resolvedFilePath, renameFile, callback);
fs.unlink(resolvedFilePath,callback);
=======================
flag:
  - Reading files
        r    - Open file for reading .
        r + - Open file for reading and writing .
        rs - Open file for reading in synchronous mode .
        rs + - Open file for reading and writing , asking the OS to open it synchronously .
    - Writing to files
        W - Open file for writing . The file is created ( if it does not exist ) or truncated ( if it exists ) .
        wx Like ' w ' but fails if the path exists .
        W + - Open file for reading and writing .
        wx + - Like ' w + ' but fails if the path exists .
      Appending to files
        a - Open file for appending .
        ax - Like ' a ' but fails if the path exists .
        a + - Open file for reading and appending .
        ax + - Like ' a + ' but fails if the path exists .
